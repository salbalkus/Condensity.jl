# Oracle Density Estimator

In some situations, the true conditional density is known, and we can use this information to estimate the conditional density. This is useful in settings where we have a known parametric form for the conditional density, but we don't know the parameters. It is especially useful for providing a "ground truth" in statistical simulations.
